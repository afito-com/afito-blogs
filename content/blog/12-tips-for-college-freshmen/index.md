Are you heading off to college for the first time this fall? Being a college freshman is exciting, but it’s also a whole lot of new experiences packed into one year, which can be stressful. Here are a few helpful tips for the first-time university student!

# 1. Making it to class on time might be a challenge, so be prepared!

In high school, it’s generally easy to make it to class on time. You just have to walk from room to room between classes. But in college, it’s all too easy to forget, lose track of time, or sleep in. You’ll have to stay organized!

# 2. You should get involved with some activities, but don’t let them affect your classwork.

There are TONS of activities available at your college! Get involved! But remember, schoolwork comes first if you want to get good grades your freshman year.

# 3. You probably aren’t required to live in the dorms… living off-campus might be better!

Some colleges require freshmen to live on campus, but others don’t. There are some huge benefits to living off campus! [Here are a few](https://afito.com/blog/on-campus-vs-off-campus-housing/).

# 4. You’ll need to study twice as much as you think you do.

In high school, many students can still get good grades with minimal studying. But the same isn’t true for most college classes: you’ll need to study. We know, you’ve heard it from your parents and teachers, but it’s true!

# 5. Plagiarism is a BIG deal!

Again, your teachers and parents have probably told you to avoid plagiarism. Listen to them! Learn exactly how to avoid it. Failing to do so can have serious consequences on your college career and job opportunities.

# 6. Take extra care to stay healthy.

It can be tough to stay healthy when you move away from home for the first time. It’s your responsibility to eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, and reduce stress. If you don’t stay healthy, you’ll struggle to enjoy your freshman year and succeed in school.

# 7. Take advantage of help when you need it.

Having a rough time with your mental health? Struggling in a class? No matter your problem, there’s probably a whole system in place to help you out. Never be afraid to seek help—you don’t have to do things on your own!

# 8. Try to meet new people.

Whether your high school friends are at your new college or not, you should work to build new relationships with your neighbors, classmates, and more. You might just find your new best friends!

# 9. Build relationships with your professors.

In addition to meeting other students, you’ll want to get to know your professors so they can assist you with schoolwork, internships and more.

# 10. Get to know the town/city sooner rather than later.

Get to know your new town: where to shop, where to hang out, where to get the best pizza.

# 11. Be a good roommate.

Whether you live on campus or off-campus, you need to keep up a good relationship with your roommate(s). Be courteous and obey the golden rule!

# 12. Make your new room/apartment feel like home.

Decorate your new place in a way that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. Your room should be your retreat from the stresses of college life.
