Renting your first off-campus apartment is an exciting milestone, but it can also be a huge source of stress if you are unprepared. Whether you are moving out of your parents' house or seeking alternatives to on-campus housing, there are several things you should know before you begin your student housing search. 
## Start Your Search Early
Off-Campus housing can be the best student housing option for many, but it can be difficult to find off-campus apartments if you’re not proactive in your search. It is recommended to start your search for student housing 8-12 months in advance for areas with a highly competitive rental market. For areas that are not as competitive, 2-6 months is recommended. Begin your student housing search as early as possible to avoid competing with other students seeking off-campus living arrangements. 
## Take Advantage of Resources
If you are unsure where to begin your search for student housing, there are several resources available. First, check if [Afito.com](https://afito.com) has listings for your school -- Afito only lists rentals designed for students. If your school isn't on there, that's okay too. Most universities offer off-campus living services. It is also possible to find local listings in the newspaper or by driving around campus looking for rental signs. However, the best place to begin your student housing search is online. If your school isn't on [Afito.com](https://afito.com), other listing sites like [Zillow.com](https://zillow.com) may have some student housing options and can connect you with landlords near your school.
## Plan Your Budget
When searching for student housing, consider your living costs to see whether the rent will fit into your budget. This way, you won't make the mistake of signing a lease on an apartment you can’t afford. The general rule of thumb is that your monthly income should be three times your monthly rent, although your situation may be different depending on if you receive aid from your parents or other sources. 
If affordable student housing is your goal, planning your budget in advance is an effective way to determine if off-campus living is right for you. Planning your budget before your student housing search can help you decide where you can cut costs and how many roommates you will need.
## Distance is Key
Proximity to campus can greatly affect the cost of rent. The closer to campus a property is, the higher the rent is likely going to be. If you have access to a vehicle, the best option for affordable student housing is looking for properties in neighboring towns. Living just 10-15 minute from campus can save you up to hundreds a month.

You should also take into account your daily commute; your distance from classes and other on-campus activities can greatly affect your experience with off-campus living. If you can find an off-campus apartment within walking distance from classes, a grocery store, and anything else you will need, you can forgo the added cost of fuel or car insurance.
