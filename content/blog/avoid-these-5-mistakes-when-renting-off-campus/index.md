As a student, you’re not necessarily an expert on finding the best place to live. You may not know how to find the best location, negotiate your rent, or choose the size of apartment that’s right for your needs. It’s easy to make mistakes. But don’t worry—we’re here to keep that from happening! Here are the top 5 mistakes students make when renting off campus, and how to avoid them.

# 1. Spending More Than You Should

We get it—budgeting is hard! College is expensive regardless of how hard you try to cut costs. But you can definitely find a budget-friendly apartment if you look hard enough. Here are the ways that people spend more than they should:

- They pay for an apartment that includes amenities they won’t use, such as a pool or gym. If you’re going to use all the amenities, then by all means, consider renting an apartment that includes them. But if you’re only going to use the swimming pool once or twice, you’re paying for something that gives you no benefit.
- They rent a fancier apartment than they can afford. Most of us would love to live in a modern, state-of-the-art, beautiful space! But the reality is that most of us can’t afford that kind of apartment in college. For now, it’s in your best interest to live in a basic apartment. Later, you can work your way up to something fancier.

# 2. Living Far Out of the Way

Chances are, you have limited time as a busy college student. You probably don’t have time to spend an hour getting to class every day, and you don’t want to live somewhere far away from the grocery store, the laundromat, and the bars. It’s ideal to live within walking or biking distance from these locations.

# 3. Not Viewing the Apartment Before Signing a Lease

We understand it can be difficult to view an apartment before signing the lease if you live far away. But we strongly encourage you to schedule a viewing if at all possible. It’s hard to know what to expect from online photos, and the last thing you want is to arrive on move-in day to discover that the place is a total dump. At Afito, we hand-pick apartments in an effort to ensure that this won’t happen—but still, it’s always a good idea to see the place for yourself and ensure it meets your expectations.

# 4. Not Reading the Terms and Conditions

Always read the terms and conditions before signing a lease. It’s not a fun thing to do, but it’s crucial to making sure you’re protected as a renter! Check the fine print and make sure you understand what is being said. If anything sticks out as a red flag, get a second opinion or bring it up with your landlord. Make sure you know what is and isn’t allowed within your lease. This can save you a whole lot of headache later.

# 5. Living Alone or Living with the Wrong Person

We get it: living alone might sound like an awesome idea when you go off to college! And don’t get us wrong, living alone can be great. But if you’re just moving into your first apartment, it’s a good idea to get a roommate. Paying rent and utilities is often a tough burden to bear alone. You’re likely to be much more financially stable if you get a roommate to split the costs with.
That being said, it can also be a mistake if you choose a bad roommate. So, choose someone that is trustworthy, responsible, and mature. Do your best to set boundaries ahead of time and establish a healthy, mutually-beneficial living environment.
