Many college students (and their parents) assume that a tiny, cramped dorm room is the best value for their money. However, even though dorm rooms were originally invented to keep costs down, they might not be the most budget-friendly living option.

Plus, when you’re stuck in the dorms, you might have to deal with roommates you may not be fond of, sharing showers with a hundred strangers, and eating expensive meals at the food court because you aren’t even allowed to have a microwave!

For all these reasons and more, it’s a great idea to find off-campus student housing! Here are some ways to fit off-campus student housing into your budget.

# Get Plenty of Roommates

College is the perfect time to live with roommates! One roommate is great, but two or more roommates is even better when it comes to saving money. When you’re living off campus, you can usually have a little more choice when it comes to who you’re living with.

Also, if you’re living in a house or a large apartment off-campus, you can fit quite a few roommates into the same place! (Of course, make sure you aren’t breaking the terms of your lease or breaking any local regulations by packing in too many people!) Hopefully, you’ll make great memories with your roommates that will last a lifetime.

# Find the Right Location

You might have heard the phrase “location is everything,” and that’s definitely true when it comes to off-campus student housing! The right location is:

- Close enough to campus that you don’t incur transportation costs
- Far enough away that prices aren’t at a premium
- Close to other amenities.

If you are on a strict budget, the last thing you need is to spend a lot of money on bus fares or gas. And you also might not be able to afford the closest apartment to campus. In addition to proximity to campus, you should also consider proximity to the things like grocery stores, transportation/bus lines, and whatever activities you like to spend your time doing. If you spend a little time finding that happy medium, and you’ll thank yourself for the rest of the school year.
