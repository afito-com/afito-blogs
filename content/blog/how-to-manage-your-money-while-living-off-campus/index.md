It may be a stereotype, but for so many people, it’s true: college students are often low on funds. College is expensive. And, with countless hours spent studying and attending classes, there’s limited time available for you to work. Most college jobs don’t pay in the millions, so you’re stuck on a budget for the time being. But don’t worry! We’re here with tips to help you manage your money while still having a comfortable place to live. You can live well and keep things affordable at the same time!

# 1. Choose a living situation that you can afford.

Whether you opt to live in an apartment, share a house with housemates, or even live on campus in the dorms, be absolutely sure that you can afford your living situation. This is your biggest monthly expense and you can’t get away with simply not paying your rent. If money is tight, you will probably need to choose a cheaper living situation or get another roommate/housemate.
But, do your best to balance this with your own convenience and safety. Don’t live in an unsafe apartment or choose one that’s prohibitively far away from conveniences. You can browse Afito based on price to find an affordable apartment that fits in your budget and has the amenities you need.

# 2. Track your spending.

We know it sounds boring, but the best way to get a handle on your spending is to track everything. Whether you use an app or decide to write it all out on paper, tracking your spending helps you understand where your money is going so you can budget better. It might sound like a chore, but it can REALLY pay off—not just now, but all throughout your life! And with an app linked to your bank account, it’s really not that hard!

# 3. Get good at shopping for deals.

The truth is, you will have to spend money, even when money is tight. There are everyday necessities: clothing, household items, food. And obviously, you want to have fun sometimes, whether that means going to a movie, ordering pizza with friends, or buying yourself something that you really want. So, no matter what you’re buying, try to find a good deal. Buy your groceries when they’re on sale. Shop the thrift store for clothes and home furnishings. Again, this is a great skill that will be beneficial for the rest of your life!

# 4. Don’t overuse credit cards!

Millions of people fall into the trap of overusing credit cards each year. Don’t fall into this trap! A credit card might seem like the perfect way to tide you over until you get more money. But this often isn’t the case. Only charge as much as you know you can pay off. You don’t want to start your adult life out in debt. However, it’s OK to use a credit card for some purchases, because it’ll help you build credit that will be beneficial when you go to buy a car or even a home.
We hope these money tips help you out as you go through college and prepare for the rest of your life!
