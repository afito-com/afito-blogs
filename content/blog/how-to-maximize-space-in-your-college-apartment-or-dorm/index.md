Making the transition from your parents’ home to an apartment as a college student can be a challenge. You may be used to having square footage to spare, but now, space is very limited. But you don’t have to be uncomfortable just because your apartment is small. Here are some of the tops ways you can maximize space in the most cramped college apartment!

# 1. Use storage solutions for tables

Multi-tasking items are your friends when you live in a small space. Don’t just buy a side table. Buy a side table with several drawers for all your odds and ends. Use trunks for coffee tables, so you can store magazines, blankets, and other items inside. You can also buy ottomans that open up to reveal more storage space.

# 2. Don’t overdo it on the décor

Personal photographs, art, and other decorative items might make you feel more at your home while you’re at college. But when you don’t have a lot of extra space, too much décor will quickly just become clutter. Keep items that are purely decorative to a minimum. Choose classic, simple pieces instead of loud, patterned items. This will give the illusion of even less clutter.

# 3. Stick to a color scheme

When you’re choosing décor for your college apartment, you may want to consider a fairly neutral color scheme, or at least stick to a few colors that you like. Not only will your apartment look timeless, but it will also look bigger. Having too many colors and unmatching objects can make your small space feel more cluttered.

# 4. Go vertical with your storage

When you have low square footage, choose storage items that are tall instead of wide. Buy bookshelves, end tables, and dressers that are tall and thin. If you have high ceilings, take advantage of them! You can get handy organizers that hang over doors, too.

# 5. Make use of your wall space

Put your walls to work by using them for storage. Install shelves on your walls and mount your TV. You can even use hooks in your kitchen to hang up pots, pans, and large utensils. Some wall storage solutions may not be an option while you’re renting. However, there are still options for wall-mounting storage that won’t destroy your apartment or upset your landlord.

# 6. Create the illusion of more space

Take advantage of tricks that will make your space look bigger so you won’t feel as cramped. For example, painting your dresser, bookshelves, and other large items a similar color to your walls will instantly make your apartment look bigger. Hanging a few mirrors around your apartment is another classic way to make it look like you have more space.

# The right apartment is closer than you think!

When you follow these tips, your apartment will feel roomier and more comfortable! But if you haven’t quite found the perfect off-campus apartment, browse the options listed on Afito. You’ll find the perfect place for your college student budget.
