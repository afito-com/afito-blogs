# Heading to Frostburg State University in the Fall?

If you’re planning to attend Frostburg University in the fall, congratulations! This is a great university that will highly benefit your future, no matter what major or activities you choose to participate in! FSU is a small school that has many excellent programs and experiences for you to explore.

As this article is being written, it is March 2020 and a lot of things are uncertain. Classes are now being held online to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. Campus access is restricted – you have to call ahead and request to return to campus. For the most part, students have departed their residence halls and returned home for the rest of the semester. No guests are allowed in the residence halls, and those who have left campus must call ahead before returning.

But even during these times of stress, it’s important to plan for the future. What are your plans and where will you live for the next school year? Read on to learn more about your options!

# Where Do You Want to Live: On Campus or Off Campus?

Some people love the dorm lifestyle: its convenience, the social aspect, the proximity to classes and dining halls. Others love the freedom of living away from campus. Right now as we’re facing this global pandemic, the people who live off campus are probably glad that they do, as they’re able to remain in their apartments while the residence halls are closed to students. But there are benefits to both options!

# On Campus Living Options at Frostburg

If you’re starting out as a first year or second-year student, you are required to live on campus at Frostburg. This is because the university wants to foster a sense of community and make it easier for you to take part in campus activities. Living on campus at Frostburg is actually a lot better than it is at some other universities! Unlike other colleges, on-campus residents at Frostburg are able to enjoy free on campus parking, free use of laundry facilities, and other great amenities.

# Off Campus Living Options at Frostburg

Wondering if off-campus living is for you? If you are an upperclassman, you’re allow to live wherever you want. And luckily, there are many houses and apartments available for students to rent in the town of Frostburg. Most of them are still within easy walking distance of campus, so it’s no hassle at all! You can get your own apartment or you can share a house with roommates. Either way, you’ll have lots of freedom and a bit more privacy than you would in the dorms. You’ll be able to cook for yourself, you may be able to have pets, and you can have a bit more living space than you would in a small, shared dorm room.
