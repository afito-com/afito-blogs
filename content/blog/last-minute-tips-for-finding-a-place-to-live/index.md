Maybe campus housing is completely full and there’s a waiting list for your preferred dorm buildings and on-campus apartments. Perhaps your planned living arrangements fell through, or your roommate is driving you crazy and you need to move out. Or maybe you just haven’t found the right place yet and the clock is ticking. We’re experts in all things renting, and we have a few tips to share for finding a place to live at the last minute!

# Use social media

If you have plenty of connections in the area, it’s highly likely you can find a roommate through social media! Plenty of great roommate relationships have started with two strangers connecting on Facebook via a mutual friend.
Not sure what to post? Here’s an example!

“I’m looking for a place to live near the [insert your college or university] campus in [insert date or timeframe]. If you know of someone looking for a roommate or a sublet, I would be glad to get connected with them! Thanks in advance!”

We know many people personally who have found their living situation through a casual social media post like this. It’s a great way to reach a lot of people at once!

# Use word-of-mouth

You can casually spread the word that you’re looking for a place to live, much in the same way you’d post on social media. Chances are, someone knows a landlord, a person who needs a roommate, or someone who is subleasing their apartment.

# Have a budget in mind

Throughout this whole process, it’s really important to know how much you’re able to spend each month. Factor in your rent and utilities as well as other expenses, such as food and transportation. Off-campus housing comes at such a wide range of price points. Some of them may be affordable for you; others not so much.
Searching last minute can make it harder to find a good value. All of the cheaper apartments near campus are likely to be taken, leaving you with whatever is left over. But with a little bit of work, you may be able to find the perfect place.

# Reconsider your wish list

If you’re looking for an apartment super last-minute, then unfortunately, some of the perks you were looking for may not be possible. What can you compromise on? Your future place might not be everything you ever dreamed of, but it’s a roof over your head.

Ultimately, the most important thing is to have a safe and reliable place to live that is close to campus so you can focus on your studies. If you don’t get your dream apartment now, there’s always next year.
