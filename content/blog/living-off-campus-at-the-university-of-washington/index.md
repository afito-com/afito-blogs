Are you planning to go to school at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA? Or are you a current student who is thinking of moving off campus? This is the article you need if you’re still trying to figure out where to live! We’ll discuss the types of student housing you can find here in Seattle, the average prices, and more!

# Deciding Where to Live Off Campus in Seattle

Of course, there are a few things to keep in mind whenever you’re living off campus:

- <b>Location—</b>not just the distance to campus, but also the distance to the store, your friend’s residences, and popular hangout spots like bars and coffee shops.
- <b>Budget—</b>how much can you afford to spend each month?
- <b>Number of bedrooms and bathrooms—</b>chances are, you will need one or more roommates, so how many rooms do you need in order to afford the apartment without being overcrowded?
- <b>Personal preferences—</b>would you prefer to live in a high-rise apartment? A house? A pet-friendly place? Something modern, or something with historical charm?

# Cost of Living Off-Campus at the U of W in Seattle

The cost of living off-campus depends on a lot of factors: how many roommates are living in the apartment or house? How luxurious is the apartment? How many bedrooms and bathrooms are there? What is the location? And, how much will utilities (like electricity, water and internet) cost? So, it’s tough to give an estimate of how much you’ll spend each month.

If you live in a modest house or apartment with several roommates, you may be spending $200 or so month—that’s with utilities factored in.  If you want to live alone, with only one roommate, or in a nice house or apartment, you could easily spend upwards of $1000—though, we understand that’s out of reach for many college students’ budgets!
