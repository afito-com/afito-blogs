It’s March 2020. As of right now, Salisbury University students – along with most other college students across the country – are completing assignments at home in isolation, helping to prevent the spread of the virus that’s sweeping the globe. All campus buildings are closed, and all events are postponed until further notice.

The students who lived in the residence halls are no longer able to stay there at this point, which has caused turmoil for many students. This includes nearly all freshmen and sophomores – as Salisbury has a two-year residency requirement – as well as some upperclassmen who remained on campus after their sophomore year.

But at this point, no one knows what will happen next semester. Things could be back to “normal” for those who are able to return to school. So even though things are crazy right now, it’s a good idea to look forward to next semester and start making plans for where you may want to live during the school year. Here’s what you need to know about living on-campus and off-campus at Salisbury University!

# Living On Campus at Salisbury University

There are several styles of rooms available on-campus for freshmen and sophomores. For upperclassmen, there are campus-affiliated apartments where you can live. You can get a suite-style dorm or a cluster-style dorm if you’re an underclassman. The prices range roughly from $2900/semester for a triple-occupancy dorm room to a little over $4500/ semester for a one-bedroom, one-bathroom upperclassman apartment.

The more roommates you live with, the more you’ll save – so if you need affordable on-campus living, you’ll definitely want to go with a two-person or three-person dorm room. For privacy, you’ll have to pay more. When you live on campus, you’ll have many of your meals provided because you’ll have an A or B meal plan. If you’re living in the upperclassmen apartments, you can opt for no meal plan if you’d rather cook your own meals.

# Living Off Campus at Salisbury

Now that we’ve discussed your on-campus options, it’s time to talk about off-campus apartments at Salisbury University! There are several options for apartments, houses for rent, and townhomes in the city of Salisbury. Most of these will keep you close to campus, so you may still be able to walk to class just as easily as if you still lived on campus! Living off campus can potentially save you money – some shared houses can get you a bedroom for only a few hundred dollars per month. Or you can live in luxury in a nice townhouse or condo. While it may cost less, just keep in mind that you may have to pay utilities and other bills that you wouldn’t have to pay in the dorms.

Again, the more roommates you live with, the more money you’ll save. When you’re living off campus, it’s important to think about the location and the amenities you want. If you don’t mind driving to campus and finding a place to park, then you can live farther away. Otherwise, you’ll want to think about proximity to campus. Apartments can come with great amenities like a private garage, private laundry, outdoor living spaces and more. You have tons of options when it comes to living off campus!
