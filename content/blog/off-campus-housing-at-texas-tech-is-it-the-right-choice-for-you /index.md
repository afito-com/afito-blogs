Are you attending TTU this upcoming semester? Whether you’re an incoming freshman, a transfer student, or a current Texas Tech student, you’re probably looking for a place to live. There are countless options when it comes to both on-campus and off-campus housing for Red Raiders like you!

# Campus Housing at Texas Tech: Pros and Cons

TTU offers several opportunities to live on campus. Some of the upsides:

- TTU has been named one of the safest and most secure college campuses in the nation. It’s also been named among the most affordable campuses.
- They offer suite-style residence halls, apartments, and traditional dorm rooms.
- You can join a Learning Community with other students in your major.
- You can get a meal program to make it easy to grab a bite to eat before and after classes.

And here are some of the downsides:

- Choices are limited and you may not be able to choose your location. Some dorms are better than others, and you may get the short end of the stick.
- You may not be able to choose your roommate, especially if you’re a new student. You might end up with a random roommate.
- You’re subject to all on-campus rules, including no alcohol, no vaping, no pets, no candles, courtesy hours/quiet hours, etc.
- There are strict traffic and parking regulations. A campus parking permit will cost you extra.

NOTE: If you’re a new Raider with under 30 college credit hours, you’re required to live in residence halls.

# Off-Campus Housing at Texas Tech: Pros and Cons

So, onto the off-campus housing! If you’re eligible to live off-campus, we strongly encourage it for the following reasons:

- You get a ton of choice as to where to live and who to live with.
- You’ll still get to live close to campus. You might even be closer to your classes than some of the dorms would be!
- Many off-campus residences have free parking or parking spaces included in your rent, along with more parking for your guests.
- Depending on your landlord and rental contract, rules will likely be more relaxed than they would be on campus. For example, you may be able to have pets!
- Off-campus residences are often located near fun bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other hangout spots—so you’ll have plenty of options to hang out with friends and grab a bite to eat.
- Off-campus residences are often closer to grocery stores/shopping, so you can purchase what you need without hitching a ride or buying from expensive shops on campus.

And, some of the potential downsides of living off campus:

- You won’t be able to live in a Learning Community with other students in your major, which could make it harder to arrange study groups.
- Depending on where you live, you might have to walk farther to get to class.
