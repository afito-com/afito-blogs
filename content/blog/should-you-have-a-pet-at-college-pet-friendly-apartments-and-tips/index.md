Do you love pets? You’re not alone! About 68% of American households have one or more pets—that’s about 85 million pet-owning households. Maybe you’ve had small pets your whole life and can’t imagine life without them. Maybe you don’t want to leave your beloved dog or cat behind. Or maybe, you find that having an emotional support animal greatly improves your mental and physical wellbeing.

We get it! It’s tough to consider colleges knowing that you’ll likely have to leave your pets behind. With that in mind, here’s what you need to know if you want to have a pet at college.

# 1. Most Residence Halls Don’t Allow Any Pets

Some residence halls will let you have an aquatic pet in a small tank… think a betta fish or hermit crab. Others are even stricter and won’t allow any pets at all. College campuses aren’t trying to be cruel with these rules. They’re just trying to keep everyone’s best interest in mind—both students and pets—while also ensuring that residence halls remain clean, safe places to live.

# 2. There Are Pet-Friendly Apartments Near Most Campuses

Pets usually aren’t allowed in dorms or student residence halls, but that’s not a problem if you’re willing to live off campus! There are often pet-friendly places to live near campuses. Some of these apartments, condos or houses will be dog and cat friendly. Others only allow small pets, so you could potentially get a hamster, bird, or other small animal. And some will allow emotional support animals if they are truly needed and if they are well behaved.

# 3. Pets May Be Able to Visit. Check Your College’s Rules.

When you family comes to visit you on weekends, they might be able to bring the family pet along… but make sure to check the rules. They may or may not be able to bring pets into the residence halls, even for a few minutes. If pets are not allowed on campus even for visits, check for a nearby pet-friendly café or park where you can play with your pet when they come to visit.

# 4. If You Still Can’t Have a Pet, Try Volunteering at a Shelter!

Nearly every community has animal shelters and rescue groups that welcome volunteers. Find the nearest Humane Society, rescue group, or volunteer organization near your campus and see what it takes to become a volunteer. Walking the dogs at the shelter could give you some exercise, allow you to help out the community, and fulfill your need for canine cuddles!

# 5. Having a Pet Can Improve Your Quality of Life, But It Can Also Be a Ton of Work

Carefully consider whether it’s truly a good idea to have a pet at college. You’ll be busy with classes, studying, and other activities. A demanding pet, like a dog, is usually not the best choice for a college student. A small pet that’s less demanding might be a better option if you really think you need a pet at college. Be 100% sure that you can properly care for the pet:

- Cleaning up after it
- Paying for its vet care
- Buying it what it needs
- Giving it the attention it needs

All that being said, it’s up to you! Find pet-friendly places to live near your college campus at [Afito](https://afito.com/).
