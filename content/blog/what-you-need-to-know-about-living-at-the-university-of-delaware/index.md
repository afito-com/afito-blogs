UDel is one of the oldest schools in the nation, as the original academy from which it grew was founded in 1743! That’s before the United States of America even existed as we know it. In fact, some of those who signed the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution attended this academy in its early days! If you want to become a part of our nation’s history, there’s no better university to attend than this one.
Whether you’re a returning student or a first-timer, you may be struggling to decide where to live. That’s often an issue no matter what college or university a student is attending. Is it better to live in the dorms, or are the benefits to off-campus housing worth it? Read on to learn more about where you can live at the University of Delaware!

# University of Delaware Campus Housing: Your Options

The University of Delaware does its best to create welcoming, inclusive places for students to live on campus. Around 7,500 students live on-campus, and there are 22 different residence halls throughout Central, East, Laird, and the apartments. Central Campus offers historic residences that are mainly for upperclassmen, whereas East Campus is mainly home to freshmen. Laird has several suites for both underclassmen and upperclassmen.
There are a few things to be aware of when living on campus. There are hefty fees if you’re going to stay in the residence halls during Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Spring breaks, and there are also fees per day if you arrive early in the fall or leave late in the spring. However, there are great benefits too! There are always events going on on-campus, both fun and educational. There are lots of opportunities for joining student organizations, working on-campus, and volunteering in your community.

# Living Off-Campus at the University of Delaware

Many students assume that living off-campus means they’ll have to travel much further to get to class. However, that’s not always the case: there are options that are a very short walk from campus! Depending on which buildings your classes are located in, you may have a super-short walk to class each day, which is great if you enrolled in early-morning classes!
Newark is a lovely town with many historic and newer homes that are short biking, walking, or driving distances from campus. You can get a house with a few roommates and enjoy the freedom from campus – while still living close enough to ride your bike to class. As a bonus, you can be even closer to the bars and restaurants on Main St in Newark! If you’d rather not share a whole house, there are great contemporary apartments just a couple of miles from campus as well.
