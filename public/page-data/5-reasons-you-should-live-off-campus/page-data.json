Unfortunately, there are landlords out there who don’t like to rent to college students. They may see students as irresponsible, messy, or prone to being late on rent payments. But you can prove them wrong with these tips on how to be a good renter! Bonus—you’ll get your security deposit back at the end of your lease term!</p>\n<h1>Step #1: Understand the Lease</h1>\n<p>You’ll have to read through the lease in order to understand it. Make sure you know the rules involved. Are pets prohibited? Don’t bring pets into your apartment. Do you have to take trash to the curb every Tuesday? Make sure to do that! Not allowed to have noisy parties? Go to the bar instead, or have a party at a friend’s house if their apartment allows it. Understand what is and isn’t allowed, and follow these rules.</p>\n<p>If you break the terms of the lease, you will show your landlord that you’re untrustworthy. If that happens, they’ll be less likely to be lenient if you mess up in the future. You may also have to pay hefty fines for breaking the rules. Worst case scenario: Breaking the terms of your lease could even lead to you being asked to leave your apartment.</p>\n<h1>Step #2: Pay Your Rent on Time</h1>\n<p>You’ll notice in your contract that you have to pay your rent by a certain date or you’ll be subject to a fine. Often, this date is the first of the month. Pay your rent on time, or you’ll face the consequences! A few landlords may be a bit more understanding and allow you to pay a few days late if you ask first… but the vast majority of them will expect the full payment on or before the due date.</p>\n<p>Some tips for remembering to pay your rent on time: Set a calendar alert or reminder in your phone. Put a note on a physical calendar, white board, or on your fridge. Get into a habit of always checking with your roommates so you can remind each other to pay rent on time. Your landlord will appreciate it and will see you as a good, trustworthy tenant!</p>\n<h1>Step #3: Avoid Damaging the Property and You’ll Likely Get Your Deposit Back</h1>\n<p>Do your best to keep the property looking good. This is key if you want to get your deposit back! We get it: things break sometimes. Let’s say your doorknob falls off, or the dishwasher stops working. If something like that happens, get in touch with your landlord or property manager right away! They will likely send someone to fix it in the next day or two.</p>\n<p>But try to avoid breaking or damaging things. If something is clearly your fault, it’s possible that you might not get your deposit back. For example, be careful not to scratch floors or walls when moving furniture. Don’t leave carpet stains untreated. And be honest if something gets damaged while you’re living there… your landlord will find out eventually, so it’s best to be upfront.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"5 Reasons You Should Live Off
