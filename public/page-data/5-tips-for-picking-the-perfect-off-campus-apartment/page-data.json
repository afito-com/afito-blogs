There are lots of factors that you need to take into consideration when making this type of decision because one wrong move could cost you hundreds of extra dollars a month. And nobody wants that!</p>\n<p>The good news is we’ve put together 5 tips for picking the perfect off-campus apartment so you can enjoy these fun (and hopefully, educational!) years.</p>\n<h2>1. First, Make a Budget</h2>\n<p>Before you even start looking for an apartment, the first thing you should do is make a budget of what you can afford to pay for rent each month. One of the biggest mistakes students make when signing their first lease is getting something they can’t afford. The last thing you want to worry about is scraping up enough money each month to make rent. Be proactive, find out what you’re able to spend each month, and stick to it! You may not get the gorgeous apartment of your dreams on a college budget, but a smaller apartment or an extra few minutes walk to campus is probably better than going a year without any spending money.</p>\n<h2>2. Take Some Tours</h2>\n<p>Don’t just look at one apartment or housing unit. Take the time to set up multiple apartment tours and have a clear understanding of what options you have. Our advice: pick your top three off-campus living options and go tour them all. That way when it comes time to make a decision, you’ve seen everything firsthand and won’t have to worry about any surprises.</p>\n<h2>3. Location, Location, Location</h2>\n<p>Being a student means you need to spend a lot of time on campus. Whether you’re studying in the library, taking classes, or just hanging out with friends, much of your time will be spent there. So location is an important factor to consider.</p>\n<p>If it’s not located within walking distance of your class buildings, is there a bus stop nearby that can take you to class? What about other transportation opportunities? Make sure that no matter where you end up you have an easy, convenient and hopefully free way to get where you need to go.</p>\n<h2>4. Grab Some Roomies</h2>\n<p>If at all possible, get some roommates. Living with other college students can make rent and utilities cheaper and more affordable. Find people who are looking for a similar living situation as you are and find a place together!</p>\n<p>When signing a lease, make sure everyone is there and that everyone signs the lease. Depending on your lease agreement you want to make sure that if someone breaks the lease that they can be held accountable for their share of the rent.</p>\n<h2>5. Read Your Lease, Seriously!</h2>\n<p>Speaking of leases, before signing your name- read the lease! Your name is going on a legal document which means that you can be held liable for violating any of its provbisions. Take the fifteen minutes to read the lease, make sure you understand it, and then sign.</p>\n<p>So, make a budget, shop around, pay attention to the location, get some roommates, and read your lease. There you go- 5 simple things that you can do to help make your apartment hunting experience easier and more successful. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"5 Tips for Picking the Perfect Off-Campus
