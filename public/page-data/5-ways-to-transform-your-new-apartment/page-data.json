So, if you want it to really feel like home, you’ll need to add a personal touch to it! When your apartment feels like home, you’re likely to feel more relaxed. You’ll have a nice place to retreat to after the stress of classes and studying, so your mental health won’t suffer as much. Plus, your friends will be impressed with your decorating skills! So here are 5 easy ways to transform your new apartment into a relaxing home.</p>\n<h1>1. Make Your Bed Extra-Comfy</h1>\n<p>College is stressful, and you need your sleep! Put a little effort into making your bed a beautiful, comfy place to relax, whether that means getting a big cozy blanket in your favorite color or adding a few cute throw pillows for personality. If your mattress is uncomfortable, you can find mattress covers that amp up the comfort.</p>\n<h1>2. Add Some Plants (Fake or Real!)</h1>\n<p>There’s just something about greenery that makes a home feel more relaxing and lively at the same time. If you feel like you can take care of a live plant, then visit a garden center and find some easy-to-care-for houseplants or succulents. Make sure to read the care instructions to see if you have enough sunlight for them, and make sure you’re able to water them appropriately (not too little and not too much). The benefit of live houseplants is that they can actually purify your indoor air, keeping you healthier!</p>\n<p>But if you don’t want the responsibility of keeping a living plant alive, there are some great-looking fake plants out there. You can find cute faux plants at <a href=\"https://www.target.com/\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ikea.com/us/en/\">IKEA</a>, and many other stores, and they’ll make your apartment look beautiful!</p>\n<h1>3. Get a Rug or Two</h1>\n<p>People don’t always think about it, but the floor is probably one of the largest surfaces in your room or apartment. If you have bland beige carpet or tile, you might enjoy the softness, color, and pattern of a pretty rug underfoot. It’s a great way to inject a little more personality and comfort into your space!</p>\n<h1>4. Add Some Wall Art</h1>\n<p>Print out photos, find pictures that you like online, hit up the thrift store, or even create some art on your own. It can be cheap and easy to decorate your new dorm room or apartment! Choose wall art that you truly enjoy and it’ll feel like home in no time. You don’t have to rush to put things up on your wall just for the sake of having art. Take the time to collect things you love.</p>\n<h1>5. Add Some Extra Lighting</h1>\n<p>Some apartments, houses, and dorm rooms don’t have the best lighting. One top decor and home design tip is to have more than one source of light in each room. If you already have a bright overhead light, you’ll want a lamp or two to use in the evening. If your apartment is already dim, you might need to add a couple more lighting sources to keep it from looking like a cave.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"5 Ways to Transform Your New
