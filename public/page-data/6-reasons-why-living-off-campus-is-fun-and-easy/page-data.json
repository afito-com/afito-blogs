Here are some reasons why you should consider the off-campus life. Not only is it fun to live off campus, but it might be even easier than you think!</p>\n<h1>1. Living off campus gives you tons of freedom!</h1>\n<p>When you live in the dorms, there are quite a few rules, and there’s an RA nearby at all times making sure you follow the rules. In a dorm, you’re limited when it comes to decorating, entertaining guests, and much more. Plus, you’ll probably have to share restrooms with your whole floor. But when living off campus, you get the freedom to stay up as late as you want, light candles when you want—in some cases you can even bring your pet!</p>\n<h1>2. Living off-campus is often more affordable.</h1>\n<p>You will get more freedom when it comes to choosing the apartment in the first place. Instead of getting assigned to a specific dorm room, you can choose the exact apartment you want to live in based on its location, amenities, size, and price. It is often the case that off campus housing is substantially more affordable than on-campus options.</p>\n<h1>3. You’ll often get more space compared to dorm living.</h1>\n<p>Dorm rooms are famously cramped and small, but off-campus housing gives you more options. If a larger living space is important to you, you can definitely find it. Of course, you’ll probably still need to get a roommate or a few—but you won’t be nearly as cramped. Also, off-campus options usually have more parking space for your car and your guests’ vehicles too.</p>\n<h1>4. Many off-campus housing options have great amenities like pools or gyms.</h1>\n<p>Lots of off-campus apartments have amenities located right in the building, such as swimming pools, fitness centers, common areas, and more. You might even get your own washer and dryer, which is super convenient for busy college students! If these things are important to you, you may want to consider the off-campus life.</p>\n<h1>5. Off-campus housing is still close to your classes!</h1>\n<p>In some cases, you could potentially even be CLOSER to your classes when living off-campus—it all depends on the situation. Nearly every college or university has plenty of houses and apartments surrounding it, so if you want to be within walking distance, it isn’t a problem. Other cities are more spread out and it might take a few more minutes to get to campus—however, it may be totally worth it to you.</p>\n<h1>6. It’s easy to find great off-campus rentals that work for you.</h1>\n<p>With Afito, you can search for the perfect off-campus apartment for your needs. We make it simple!
