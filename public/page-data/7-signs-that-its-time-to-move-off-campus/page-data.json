You want more control over your living space</h1>\n<p>Dorms make it notoriously hard to personalize your space! Your options are limited when it comes to furniture, décor, and more. Plus, you’re in close quarters with a couple hundred of your peers, which can make it difficult to get your rest if you’re a light sleeper. While off-campus apartments do still have rules and limitations, they tend to be a bit more lax than most dorm rooms. You’ll never have an RA poking their head into your room, which can be nice if you’re looking for more responsibility and independence.</p>\n<h1>2. You’re not a fan of the random roommate system</h1>\n<p>Maybe you want to live with friends and/or a significant other. In that case, you may have to move off campus. Most dorms aren’t co-ed, but in an apartment, you can choose pretty much anyone you want as your roommate, even if they’re the opposite gender.</p>\n<h1>3. You need to save some money</h1>\n<p>Some people are surprised when they hear that off-campus housing can be even cheaper than on-campus housing. When you live on-campus, you often have to pay for a meal plan, so that can add even more costs, whereas cooking at home in your apartment can save you money on a daily basis. It depends on the exact scenario though, so you’ll need to do the math!</p>\n<h1>4. You’d like to get a pet</h1>\n<p>There are very few on-campus housing options that allow pets. Some dorms may allow you to get a fish or hermit crab in a small tank, but the options are pretty limited beyond that. For a dog or a cat, or even a small rodent, you’ll have to search for a pet-friendly rental in your area.</p>\n<h1>5. You want to cook your own meals</h1>\n<p>Whether you love to cook or you’re tired of dining center food or you just want to save some money, the solution is the same: get an apartment with a kitchen and start cooking! Whether you are meal prepping for the week or baking a batch of chocolate chip cookies to fuel your study session, you’ll be so glad to have a kitchen again after living in the dorms.</p>\n<h1>6. You want more amenities than the ones available in your dorm</h1>\n<p>Most dorm rooms lack even the simplest of appliances. Not all dorms even have a microwave! But with an apartment, not only will you have a full kitchen, but you may also be able to get other great amenities. For example, maybe you’re tired of trekking across campus to get your workout in. In that case, look for an off-campus apartment with a gym in-building. Got lots of laundry? You may be able to find an apartment with your very own washer and dryer included!</p>\n<h1>7. You’re planning to stick around for the summer and/or holidays</h1>\n<p>In some cases, you’ll have to sign a lease for an entire year. This can be a great thing: you don’t have to find a new living arrangement come summer! It can also be a bad thing if you’re not sure whether you’re going to stay in the area. For example, if you’re thinking about studying abroad, then signing an off-campus lease can be tricky. But if not, then go ahead and start searching for your new off-campus apartment on Afito!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"7 Signs That It’s Time to Move Off
