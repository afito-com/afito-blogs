Find out everything that’s included in the rent</h1>\n<p>For example, you don’t want to move in and suddenly realize that your apartment doesn’t come with a parking space for your car. And if you assume that certain utilities are included in your monthly rent, you might get sticker shock when you find out that you’re actually responsible for paying the electricity bill. When touring properties, you can ask the property manager what’s included. And always make sure to read through the rental contract and double-check everything before you sign!</p>\n<h1>2. Ask about the laundry situation</h1>\n<p>Busy students don’t have a lot of time to spend on laundry, so it’s important to make sure laundry is easy to do—you don’t want to have to take the bus across town to wash your socks! Are there washers and dryers in each apartment? Or are there shared ones in the building? If so, how much does it cost to do your laundry onsite? If there’s no laundry onsite, is there a good laundromat nearby? This is one of the most overlooked things that can really make a difference in your life.</p>\n<h1>3. Find out if pets are allowed</h1>\n<p>Whether you have a pet or not, it’s good to know whether or not pets are allowed. Some apartments won’t even let a visitor bring a pet—even if it’s just for a few minutes. So, find out how strict the rules are regarding pets. If you’re interested in getting a pet in the future, figure out what types are and aren’t allowed.</p>\n<h1>4. Decide whether the apartment seems safe</h1>\n<p>You want to feel completely safe and comfortable in your own home, even if it’s just a rental. So, when you look at apartments, make sure that it’s someplace where you’d feel comfortable being alone at night. It should have good locks and security features such as outdoor lighting.</p>\n<h1>5. Check to ensure the appliances, plumbing, etc. are well maintained</h1>\n<p>So, your first college apartment might not be super-luxurious—but your appliances, faucets, and toilets should definitely work properly. After all, you’re paying monthly rent for the ability to use these items. In a perfect world, you could assume that all these things work properly, but it doesn’t hurt to check before you move in.</p>\n<h1>6. Check whether the apartment has heating, AC, etc.</h1>\n<p>Depending on your climate, some apartments might not have heating or AC. Since you want to be comfortable in every season, this is definitely something to take note of! Make sure you also know who’s responsible for paying the heating, electricity, and other utilities bills. Some apartments may include certain utilities in the monthly rent, while other apartments leave it up to the tenants to pay their utility bills separately from the monthly rent.</p>\n<h1>7. Find out exactly how long it takes to get to class</h1>\n<p>Time yourself walking, driving, or taking public transportation to campus. You definitely want to know what you’re in for, especially if you’ll be on campus early in the morning or late at night. You don’t want your living situation to get in the way of your studies.\nHopefully these tips will help you find the best college apartment for your needs!
