There are so many amazing things about moving across the country for college. You get to experience a new place and new people. Exciting possibilities await! But the whole process of moving long-distance can be rough. There are lots of logistics involved when you’re packing up your things to move out to school for the year. So, here are some tips for moving across the country, stress-free!</p>\n<h1>1. Try to Travel Light</h1>\n<p>Do you have a lot of stuff? That could be a problem if you’re moving across the country, especially if you’ll be living in a dorm room or a small apartment. Moving more stuff costs way more money if you’re using a moving service. It can also be more stressful trying to fit everything. So, if you can, try to travel light. Leave some things at home if possible, donate what you don’t need, and buy new household items when you get to your new city instead of buying them before you leave.</p>\n<h1>2. Package Everything Securely</h1>\n<p>We’ve been guilty of just throwing stuff in the back of the car and hitting the road, but if you really want a low-stress and organized move, then you’ll definitely want to get some boxes, pack your items in an organized way, and label everything so you know what’s where. This becomes more important if you’re moving across the country. Things need to be well-packaged to ensure they reach their destination safe and undamaged. This is especially important for fragile items, like TVs or computers!</p>\n<h1>3. Keep the Essentials With You</h1>\n<p>If there’s anything you really don’t want to lose, or something that you’ll need right away, you need to keep it with you. Moving trucks and shipping services can get delayed, and you don’t want to be caught without your most important items. Maybe you’re traveling by car, or maybe you’re flying out to your new university. No matter how you’re traveling, you should keep your essentials close by! This might include hygiene products, a few sets of clothes, your laptop, chargers, and any valuable/important belongings that you might be bringing to college with you.</p>\n<h1>4. Double-Check Your Scheduling</h1>\n<p>It’s important to coordinate your moving truck or package arrival with your move-in date. Double-check with your landlord and the movers/shipping service to make sure you’ll have keys and access to the new place by the time you and your stuff get there.</p>\n<h1>5. Use Checklists to Your Advantage</h1>\n<p>It’s always a good idea to make a list of everything you need and everything you’re planning to bring. This accomplishes a few things: it makes it less likely that you’ll forget items back home and it gives you an idea of how much stuff you have (which is useful if you’re packing up a vehicle or hiring a moving service).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Moving Out of State?
