Whether you’re an incoming freshman, a transfer student, or a current Texas Tech student, you’re probably looking for a place to live. There are countless options when it comes to both on-campus and off-campus housing for Red Raiders like you!</p>\n<h1>Campus Housing at Texas Tech: Pros and Cons</h1>\n<p>TTU offers several opportunities to live on campus. Some of the upsides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>TTU has been named one of the safest and most secure college campuses in the nation. It’s also been named among the most affordable campuses.</li>\n<li>They offer suite-style residence halls, apartments, and traditional dorm rooms.</li>\n<li>You can join a Learning Community with other students in your major.</li>\n<li>You can get a meal program to make it easy to grab a bite to eat before and after classes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And here are some of the downsides:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choices are limited and you may not be able to choose your location. Some dorms are better than others, and you may get the short end of the stick.</li>\n<li>You may not be able to choose your roommate, especially if you’re a new student. You might end up with a random roommate.</li>\n<li>You’re subject to all on-campus rules, including no alcohol, no vaping, no pets, no candles, courtesy hours/quiet hours, etc.</li>\n<li>There are strict traffic and parking regulations. A campus parking permit will cost you extra.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTE: If you’re a new Raider with under 30 college credit hours, you’re required to live in residence halls.</p>\n<h1>Off-Campus Housing at Texas Tech: Pros and Cons</h1>\n<p>So, onto the off-campus housing! If you’re eligible to live off-campus, we strongly encourage it for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You get a ton of choice as to where to live and who to live with.</li>\n<li>You’ll still get to live close to campus. You might even be closer to your classes than some of the dorms would be!</li>\n<li>Many off-campus residences have free parking or parking spaces included in your rent, along with more parking for your guests.</li>\n<li>Depending on your landlord and rental contract, rules will likely be more relaxed than they would be on campus. For example, you may be able to have pets!</li>\n<li>Off-campus residences are often located near fun bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other hangout spots—so you’ll have plenty of options to hang out with friends and grab a bite to eat.</li>\n<li>Off-campus residences are often closer to grocery stores/shopping, so you can purchase what you need without hitching a ride or buying from expensive shops on campus.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And, some of the potential downsides of living off campus:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You won’t be able to live in a Learning Community with other students in your major, which could make it harder to arrange study groups.</li>\n<li>Depending on where you live, you might have to walk farther to get to class.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Still trying to decide whether you want to live in Texas Tech University student housing or in an apartment off campus?
