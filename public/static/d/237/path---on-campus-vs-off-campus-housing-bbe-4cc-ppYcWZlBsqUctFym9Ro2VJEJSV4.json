While some may prefer the community aspect of living on-campus, others may prefer the independence of living off-campus. When looking at student housing options, the choice you make can affect your entire college experience, therefore it’s important to consider the best student housing options for your situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Living in on-campus housing</strong> can be a great way to build your social circle and be involved in campus life.  In most cases, you will be in close proximity to everything else on campus such as: your classes, the dining hall, libraries, and the student center. Most campuses also provide transportation services that make it easy to get around campus. On-campus housing is often considered to be the best option for incoming freshmen and is sometimes mandated by the school for underclassmen.\nHowever, for most on-campus housing options, there are rules and regulations you have to follow. Infringement of these rules can often lead to suspension or expulsion from the residence hall or even the university. On top of strict regulations, campus housing can often be expensive and may not be the most affordable student housing option. </p>\n<p><strong>Living off-campus</strong> is a great idea for those seeking more private student housing options and can be an attractive alternative for those seeking independence from the commotion of campus life. Off-campus housing is often cheaper than living on-campus and is the best student housing option for upperclassmen who wish to focus on their studies.</p>\n<p>When looking for off-campus living arrangements it’s important to consider the safety of the neighborhood as well as the proximity to campus. It’s also important to know what to look for in a landlord when looking at off-campus housing options. Because off-campus housing isn’t owned by the school, make sure to be aware of local ordinances and other regulations set by the township. </p>\n<p>While off-campus housing can seem like the easy choice, it comes with responsibilities. On top of rent and utilities, renters generally spend more time grocery-shopping, preparing meals, cleaning, and commuting. Despite these obligations, living off-campus offers even more freedom than you would get from living in a residence hall. At the same time, it helps with the transition to life after college by acclimating you to responsibilities like house maintenance, rent, and other bills.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Both on- and off-campus housing have their benefits and drawbacks. It’s up to you to weigh the pros and cons and figure out the best student housing option for you.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"On-Campus VS Off-Campus Housing","author":"Xingyu
